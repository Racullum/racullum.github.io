		<p>Hey there, my name is Ryan and Iâ€™m a Software Engineer/Game Developer! I love working on products that deliver impactful results to a user. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Arkansas and now I live in Kansas City working for a health tech company. I'm a perpetual learner always looking to better myself and my code. I believe life is too short for stagnation and that we should always look to push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
