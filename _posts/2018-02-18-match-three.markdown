This is a Bejeweled clone developed in Java using the LibGdx framework. The objective of the game is to match three gems of the same shape within a given time limit. Each piece carries a value and is incremented any time a match is made. Game programmed by me and art from <a href="http://www.opengameart.org">opengameart.org</a>.
