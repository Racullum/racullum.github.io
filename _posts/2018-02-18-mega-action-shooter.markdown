A top-down 2D shooter prototype developed in Unity. The player is faced with multiple enemy types with the ability to use a range of different weapons. Every weapon fires a unique projectile, but the main logic is all inherited from one base class. There are three enemy types each with their own unique health level. AI is configured via a third party plugin called A* Pathfinding Project. The prototype contains three differently designed levels. All programming is done in C# and art is from <a href="http://www.opengameart.org">opengameart.org</a>.
