This is a mobile 2D Platformer made in Unity where enemy and obstacle avoidance is crucial. The game includes different enemy patrol patterns and a item collection system written in C#. There are five stages of increasing difficulty and the ability to come back to a level if you decide to take a break. The game is programmed all by myself using art downloaded from <a href="http://www.opengameart.org">opengameart.org</a>.
